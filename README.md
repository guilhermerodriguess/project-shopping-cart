# Shopping Cart Project

Hello! Welcome to my Shopping Cart project repository. In this project, you will develop a fully dynamic shopping cart, consuming data directly from the Mercado Livre API. In addition, you will have the opportunity to apply test-driven development (TDD) to ensure code quality.

## Mandatory Requirements Developed

1. I developed tests with at least 25% of total coverage and 100% of the `fetchProducts` function, guaranteeing the reliability of the function responsible for fetching the products in the API.

2. I created a product listing using the `fetchProducts` function and consuming the Mercado Libre API.

3. I developed tests with at least 50% of total coverage and 100% of the `fetchItem` function, which fetch the data of a specific product in the API.

4. I implemented the `fetchItem` function to return a product's data and add it to the shopping cart.

5. When clicking on a product in the shopping cart, I implemented the functionality to remove it from the list.

6. I developed tests with at least 75% of total coverage and 100% of the `saveCartItems` function, responsible for saving cart items in localStorage.

7. Implemented the `getSavedCartItems` function to load the shopping cart items from localStorage, ensuring the data is retrieved correctly.

8. Items added to the shopping cart are saved in localStorage and are loaded when starting the page, allowing the user to view the items that were previously selected.

9. I implemented the calculation of the total value of the items in the shopping cart, displaying the result in the element with the class `total-price`.

10. Added functionality to clear the shopping cart, allowing the user to empty the cart and remove all selected items.

11. During the API request, I added an element with the text "Loading..." to inform the user that the operation is in progress.

Thanks for checking out my Shopping Cart project. Now you have a dynamic shopping cart, with the possibility to add, remove, calculate the total amount and clear the selected items. In addition, the application makes use of tests to ensure the quality of the code. Feel free to explore the project, and if you have any questions or need help, I'm here to help.
